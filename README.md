Answers to 4 questions for Ada Developers Academy.

1. I think knowing how to program is like knowing a powerful spell. Will school and inspire my daughter. I thought myself very basic HTML & CSS so I can make a website in 09. Briefly studied linguistics.
2. In the next 2 years my goal is to seek a secure employment with a big company in Seattle. I think I'm more intrapreneurial than entrepreneurial. Next 5 years? I may even start a business in education.
3. When I came to the US I lost my core identity. Painful setbacks such as loss of comfort zone, unstable employment and multiple miscarriages could have been overcome easier with more optimism and plan.
4. Taught myself to ride a bicycle when I was 32 and sufficient HTML to make a portfolio website. To knit and to bake. Also: debate & joke in English. Necessity sets a stage. Solving problems brings joy.
